### Your first gift
Use the `/gift {player name}` command in order to transfer the item in your main hand to another player, after that you will receive a message to either type in `/gift confirm` or `/gift cancel`. If you choose to confirm and the receivers inventory is full, your items will go straight back to your inventory.
