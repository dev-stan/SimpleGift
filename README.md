# Simple Gift
### About
With configurable permission nodes, messages and a small amount of code, this plugin brings a new gifting system which will change any server for the better.

### Commands
- `gift` - Gift an item to a player.
- `gift help` - The plugin help page
### Permission nodes
- `gift.send` - Grants access to the `/gift` command.
- `gift.admin` - Grants access to all commands.
### Features
All messages and permission nodes can be configured in the `config.yml` file.
