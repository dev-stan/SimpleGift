# Simple Gift
### About
The name says it all! It's a simple `/gift` plugin designed with simplicity in mind. SimpleGift comes with the most basic features, so players don't get confused and can start making gifts almost instantly. You can find more information in the [tutorial file](https://github.com/dev-stan/SimpleGift/blob/dev-util/TUTORIAL.md).

### Commands
- `gift` - Gift an item to a player.
- `gift help` - The plugin help page
### Permission nodes
- `gift.send` - Grants access to the `/gift` command.
- `gift.admin` - Grants access to all commands.
### Features
All messages and permission nodes can be configured in the `config.yml` file.
Use the `/gift` command to give the item in your main hand to another player, type in `/gift confirm` to finish the operation. If the receiver does not have space in their inventory, the item will be returned to the sender.
### Ideas
- [x] Configurable permission nodes and messages.
- [ ] Implement config options in the actual code.
- [ ] `gift reload` command which will be used to reload the plugin `config.yml`.

This project will be further developed.
